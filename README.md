# AttuneBridge

AttuneBridge is a lean micro-SaaS prototype for small service businesses to capture private customer feedback before negative public reviews happen.

## Overview

After a service interaction, a business shares an AttuneBridge link with a customer. The customer selects one of three outcomes:

- Great
- Okay
- Not Good

Positive responses can be guided toward a public review prompt. Negative responses are routed to a private feedback form sent directly to the business owner.

## Problem Statement

Small service businesses often discover unhappy customers too late, after a public review is already posted. They need a simple way to surface concerns early and create a chance to resolve issues privately.

## Solution Summary

AttuneBridge creates a lightweight feedback checkpoint between service completion and public review behavior. It enables early dialogue, helps recover at-risk experiences, and protects reputation without complex workflows.

## Target Customers

Primary audience: small service businesses, including:

- Tattoo studios
- Salons
- Massage therapists
- Dentists
- Chiropractors
- Therapists
- Aesthetic clinics

## Value Proposition

- Catch dissatisfaction before it becomes a public review
- Give owners direct, actionable private feedback
- Keep setup and daily use simple
- Offer a practical, low-friction reputation protection workflow

## MVP Scope

The MVP includes only:

- Landing page
- Customer feedback page (Great / Okay / Not Good)
- Private feedback form for negative experiences
- Email notification to business owner
- Simple dashboard (optional, minimal)

## Out of Scope (For Now)

- Review platform API integrations
- SMS workflows
- Complex analytics
- CRM features
- Multi-location management
- Advanced reporting
- Heavy automation
- Any feature creep beyond MVP validation needs

## Pricing Hypothesis

Early pricing assumption: small monthly subscription for solo operators and small teams (for example, low double-digit USD/month), focused on simplicity and clear ROI versus a single lost customer or negative review.

This is a hypothesis to test, not a finalized pricing model.

## Validation Strategy

- Demo the prototype to real small business owners
- Observe if value is understood within seconds
- Capture willingness-to-pay reactions
- Measure if businesses would use it in real customer follow-up
- Collect objections and refine positioning before expanding scope

## Success Criteria

Validation is successful if early users consistently show:

- Clear understanding of the product value quickly
- Strong acknowledgment of the underlying pain
- Willingness to try the workflow with real customers
- Indication they would pay for a simple version

Secondary success signal:

- The product remains easy to explain, easy to demo, and easy to iterate without added complexity
